## 📉 Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy

A Business-Focused Analytics & Visualization Project

**📌 Project Overview**

Customer churn is one of the biggest revenue risks for subscription-based businesses. Losing a customer not only impacts immediate revenue but also reduces lifetime value, increases acquisition costs, and weakens long-term growth.

This project approaches churn as a forward-looking business problem, not just a historical metric.

I built an end-to-end churn analytics solution that combines:

-> Churn probability predictions

-> Customer behavior analysis

-> Revenue impact quantification

-> Actionable retention insights

The final output is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to help business, marketing, and customer success teams identify at-risk customers early and act before churn occurs.

🎯 Business Problem

The business operates on a B2C subscription model and has observed:

-> Rising churn within the first 30 days of subscription

-> Revenue leakage due to early customer exits

-> Limited visibility into who is likely to churn and why

Key Challenges:

-> Churn reporting is reactive, not predictive

-> Churn probabilities exist but are not actionable

-> No clear view of revenue at risk

-> Retention teams lack prioritization

🧠 Project Objectives

This project aims to:

-> Predict customer churn risk using behavioral signals

-> Segment customers into Low, Medium, and High risk

-> Quantify monthly revenue at risk

-> Identify the key drivers of churn

-> Enable targeted and efficient retention strategies

📊 Dashboard Overview

The solution is delivered through three connected Power BI dashboards, each designed for a specific business purpose.

1️⃣ Customer Churn Overview (Executive Dashboard)

-> Overall churn rate

-> Average churn probability

-> Revenue at risk

-> High-risk customer percentage

-> Churn vs non-churn split

-> Churn probability distribution

Audience: Leadership, strategy, decision-makers
Goal: Understand churn severity and revenue exposure at a glance

2️⃣ Churn Drivers & Customer Segmentation

-> Key behavioral churn drivers (inactivity, complaints, support pain)

-> Revenue at risk by subscription plan

-> Regional and plan-based churn heatmaps

-> Engagement decline vs churn risk analysis

Audience: Product, marketing, analytics teams
Goal: Understand why customers churn and where risk is concentrated

3️⃣ Churn Risk Action Plan & Retention Strategy

-> High-risk customers requiring immediate action

-> Revenue exposure by churn risk level

-> High-value vs high-risk customer segmentation

-> Customer distribution across churn risk tiers

Audience: Customer success, CRM, retention teams
Goal: Convert churn insights into direct action

🧩 Data Overview

The dataset represents a B2C subscription business and includes:

-> Customer demographics and regions

-> Subscription plans and pricing

-> Engagement and inactivity metrics

-> Support interactions and complaint counts

-> Churn labels and churn probability scores

Note: The dataset used is anonymized and structured for analytical demonstration purposes.

⚙️ Data Preparation & Modeling Logic

-> Data cleaning and feature validation performed before analysis

-> Churn probability scores generated using a pre-built model

Customers categorized into:

1) Low Risk

2) Medium Risk

3) High Risk

Revenue at Risk calculated by aggregating monthly revenue for high-risk customers

All metrics transformed into business-friendly KPIs using Power BI (DAX)

💡 Key Business Recommendations

-> Prioritize retention of high-risk, high-revenue customers

-> Trigger early interventions based on inactivity and complaint signals

-> Design plan-specific retention strategies for high-risk subscription tiers

-> Replace blanket discounts with targeted, data-driven incentives

-> Use churn probability as a core customer health KPI

📈 Business Impact

-> Identified ~₹30K in monthly revenue at risk

-> Enabled proactive churn prevention instead of reactive reporting

-> Improved efficiency of retention and customer success teams

-> Increased ROI on marketing and retention spend

-> Established a scalable churn prevention framework

🛠 Tools & Technologies

-> Power BI – Data modeling, DAX, interactive dashboards

-> Excel / CSV – Data preprocessing

-> GitHub – Version control and project documentation

🚀 Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates how analytics can:

-> Move beyond prediction to decision-making

-> Align data science outputs with business KPIs

-> Directly influence revenue, customer experience, and growth

-> It reflects a real-world analytics workflow, from problem framing to business impact.
